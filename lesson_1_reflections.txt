1. Reflections of learning to find a diff between two files to fine a bug
 
* After all these years, I did know of this basic tool
* It is very useful to be able to find a diff between any two files and not guess.

2. 	How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

* Previous version automatically saved is very useful
* Wiki, google docs, box, netapp home all support this. I think internally all use snapshots.
